# Concert Wrist Light Trigger

## Overview

This repository contains captured sub-GHz (433.92Mhz) frames that can trigger concert hand wristbands to create a synchronized light show. The frames are intended to be used with the Flipper Zero device for experimentation and educational purposes.

## Disclaimer

**Note: Do not use this code to spoil or disrupt any concert or people's experience. Respect the event organizers, performers, and the audience. The intention is purely educational and for experimentation in controlled environments.**

## Usage

Put these files on your flipper to play them.

I captured a 30mins flow during a show, which I would like later to segment into smaller specifics parts. For now, I don't have any detailed information about it.

The captured frame include:

* Turn off
* Blink red
* Orange
* Rainbow
* Maybe something else

Please feel free to provide additional details after testing it so that I can put a releveant name on the future segmented files.


## Disclaimer of Responsibility
I am not responsible for any negative consequences resulting from the use or misuse of these files. Users are advised to adhere to ethical guidelines and respect the rights and experiences of others.

## Contributions
Contributions are welcome! If you want to help me to segment this one big file into smaller and specific one, that would be really appreciated.
If you have new radio frames, feel free to fork the repository and submit a pull request.
