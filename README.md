# Concert Wrist Light Trigger

## Overview

This repository contains captured sub-GHz (433.92Mhz) frames that can trigger concert hand wristbands to create a synchronized light show. The frames are intended to be used with the Flipper Zero device for experimentation and educational purposes.

## Disclaimer

**Note: Do not use this code to spoil or disrupt any concert or people's experience. Respect the event organizers, performers, and the audience. The intention is purely educational and for experimentation in controlled environments.**

## Usage

Put these files on your flipper to play them.

I captured a complete flow during a show, which was later segmented into smaller parts at home. As a result, I don't have detailed information on each individual frame.

The known captured frames include:

* Turn off
* Blink red
* Orange
* Rainbow
* Maybe something else

Please feel free to provide additional details after testing them so that I can put a releveant name on these files.


## Disclaimer of Responsibility
I am not responsible for any negative consequences resulting from the use or misuse of these files. Users are advised to adhere to ethical guidelines and respect the rights and experiences of others.

## Contributions
